/**
  Write a program called 'censor' that takes in one argument on the command line. This argument is the filename of a
  newline-separated wordlist of profanity such as
  http://urbanoalvarez.es/blog/2008/04/04/bad-words-list/ or
  http://www.bannedwordlist.com/SwearWordResources.htm
  The program should then read a text from standard in, and print it out again, but replacing every instance of a word
  in the wordlist with a 'censored' version. The censored version of a word has the same first character as the word, and the rest of the characters are replaced with '*'.
  For example, the 'censored' version of 'peter' would be 'p****'
  Example:
  >echo 'You jerkface!' | censor badwords.txt
  You j***face!
